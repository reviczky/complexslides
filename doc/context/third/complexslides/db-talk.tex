% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per slide. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 slides, all told.


\startslide[title={Slide title}]
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

  \startitemize
    \item Use bullets points when appropriate.
    \item Use pictures when possible
    \item Do not put too much information on one slide

\startslide[title={The main result}]
  \startalert
    Problem Statement and why it is difficult. Some more text to just fill up
    space to show how the environment looks with a multi-line text.
  \stopalert

  \startresult
    Main result and its cool features. Some more text to just fill up
    space to show how the environment looks with a multi-line text.
  \stopresult
\stopslide

\startslide[title={Summary}]
  \startitemize
    \item The {\em first main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
    \item The {\em second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
    \item Perhaps a {\em third message}, but not more than that.
